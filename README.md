## General Info
A simple python script to track render times in Houdini
 
The script can be run basically anywhere, but it was created with rendering out Geometry primarily, as you can add metadata inside of image files, saying render times and such.

Tested on Houdini 18.5 - Windows 10.

## Setup
To use inside of Houdini, install the script to this directory:
```
houdini18.5/scripts/python
```
If the directory does not exist, create it.
